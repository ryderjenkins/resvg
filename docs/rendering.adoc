= resvg's rendering algorithm

*Note:* English is not my native language, so any grammar and style fixes are welcome.

*Note:* This document is not finished yet.

This document exists for two reasons. One, is to help me remember how `resvg` actually works.
And second, is to answer a popular question about _why resvg is so big/bloated when all it
does is executes 2D rendering API based on a simple XML file?_
And the latter question is very important since many people have a misconception about what SVG
actually is and how many things it supports.

We should note that `resvg` supports only the http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#SVG-static[static]
https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/[SVG 1.1]. It doesn't support animations, scripting, embedding into HTML, etc.
So this document will only explain how `resvg` produces a static raster image from an SVG data.

== resvg and usvg

First, we should make a clear distinction between `resvg` and `usvg`.
`resvg` as a project is pretty modular. And you can use parts of it independently.
This was an original goal. But `resvg` as a library is rather small. It simply translates
a render tree to a 2D rendering library API. All the real work is done by `usvg`.

A simplified rendering algorithm looks like this:

* (usvg) SVG file loading. SVGZ decompression.
* (usvg) XML parsing.
* (usvg) SVG parsing.
* (usvg) SVG tree to render tree conversion.
* (resvg) Rendering.

The first step is trivial, so we jump directly to XML parsing.

== XML parsing

The first obvious step is an actual XML parsing. And this is already a problem.
XML has a bad reputation, and for a reason. Mainly due to DTD and complexity in general.
It's very hard to parse XML right. And despite the abundance of XML parsing libraries for
any language, the only real solution is `libxml2`. To parse a generic SVG, an XML library should
support at least: a DOM-like tree, DTD entity references (Adobe Illustrator likes those) and namespaces.
Which most of the libraries don't.

`resvg` is trying to be a pure Rust library, so `libxml2` was not an option.
So I wrote https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree[xmlparser]
and https://github.com/RazrFalcon/xmlparser[roxmltree] specifically for `resvg`.
And since they do not have any SVG-specific code, they can be used (and are used) by other projects
in the Rust ecosystem.

Technically, an XML library should also support a non-Unicode input, but hey, it's 2020 already.

// TODO: Add an example of a very complex XML

== SVG parsing

Now we have an XML tree and it's time to convert it into an SVG tree (do not confuse with render tree).
An SVG tree has a DOM-like tree structure, but went through a lot of preprocessing:

* There are only two types of nodes: Element and Text.
* Contains SVG elements and attributes only from the http://www.w3.org/2000/svg[svg] and
  http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink[xlink] namespaces. +
  There are no namespaces in the SVG tree.
* There are no Text nodes outside the `text` element.
* Element tag names and attribute names are set to a predefined ID, and not a random string.
* Most attribute values are parsed into internal structures:
  https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#DataTypeColor[color],
  https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#DataTypeLength[length],
  https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/paths.html#PathData[path data],
  https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#DataTypeTransformList[transform],
  https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/painting.html#SpecifyingPaint[paint],
  https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#DataTypeFuncIRI[link], etc.
  This is handled by https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgtypes[svgtypes],
  which itself is like 3000 LOC. +
  `usvg` will also convert _path data_ during parsing (for performance reasons) into
  a simplified variant that has only absolute, explicit MoveTo, LineTo, CurveTo and ClosePath segments.
  So a path like this +
  `M10-20A5.5.3-4 010-.1` will be parsed as +
  `M 10 -20 A 5.5 0.3 -4 0 1 0 -0.1` and converted into +
  `M 10 -20 C 106.7 -26.6 182.9 -27.5 180.2 -22 C 177.4 -16.5 96.7 -6.7 0 -0.1`
* Text nodes are stripped according to the `xml:space` rules. +
  This is pretty a complex step. Essentially, it will collapse duplicated spaces in XML like this +
  `<text>Text <tspan> text</tspan></text>` so it will became `Text␣text` and not `Text␣␣text`.
  The problem is that `xml:space` is kinda undefined. For example, Chrome and Firefox will process
  nested, mixed `xml:space` differently.
* CSS is applied. +
  This is another complex task. We need a CSS2 parser and a selector to do this.
  `usvg` relies on https://github.com/RazrFalcon/simplecss[simplecss] which is, well, simple.
  But enough for our needs. +
  The trickiest part of this step is an order at which attributes will be resolved.
  First, we have to convert an original XML attribute. Then, apply CSS.
  And then, split the `style` attribute.
  And in case of a `use` element, we have to resolve it first, and only then apply CSS to it.
* `inherit` properties are replaced with resolved values.
* `use` elements are replaced with referenced content. +
  There are no `use` elements in the SVG tree. This may blow up the tree quite a bit, but
  it will greatly simplify the postprocessing.
* `tref` is resolved and removed. +
  The trick about `tref` is that it should be resolved using an XML tree and not an SVG tree,
  so text is referenced before trimming.
* Recursive `xlink:href` attributes are removed. +
  This is just a basic sanitization to prevent endless loops.

== SVG tree to render tree conversion

This is the part where the magic begins. Everything before this point was just a preparation.
Now can convert an SVG tree to a _render tree_.

In the case of `resvg`, the _render tree_ is a very minimal SVG subset.
It still resembles the SVG tree structure, but supports fewer elements
and way more strict about attributes. You can find more details in the
https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/blob/master/docs/usvg_spec.adoc[Micro SVG] spec.

=== Text to path conversion

This the biggest and most complex part of `resvg`.
It's basically 1/3 of the SVG tree to render tree codebase.

There are a few reasons for that:

1. https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html[SVG Text specification] is very large.
   It includes 8 elements and like 30 attributes.
2. No application has a complete SVG Text support (at least to my knowledge).
   Even browsers like Chrome and Firefox have a very limited text support.
3. Text rendering is OS-dependent. This is the only part of the SVG, except `systemLanguage`
   attribute, that relies on system settings.
   We can have different locales, fonts, rendering libraries, shaping libraries, etc.
4. We need an ability to control each glyph, which is not something many 2D rendering libraries
   allow. For example, Qt doesn't support this. Pango also has a very limited control over glyphs.
   So we have to use text shaping (harfbuzz) and font rendering (freetype) libraries directly.

All of this makes SVG Text implementation and testing very hard.

The conversion algorithm is pretty complex and well enough documented in the source code,
so there is no reason to duplicate it here.
Instead, I will illustrate the SVG Text complexity using some SVG files from the
https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg-test-suite[resvg test suite].

.`text-decoration` on a text with multiple `tspan`

.Text with the `rotate` attribute and multiple `tspan`

.Text BIDI reordering across `tspan` with paint server
image::https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg-test-suite/raw/master/doc-images/e-tspan-026.png[]

This test includes two complex tasks:

1. `tspan` styles should be applied after
   https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html#TextLayoutIntroduction[text chunk]
   shaping and not per `tspan`.
   So a single `tspan` can be visually split in two (or multiple), like in our case.
1. `tspan` doesn't have a bounding box. So if a `tspan` references a paint server
   (like a linear gradient in our case) with `objectBoundingBox` units, then the bounding box
   of the whole `text` element should be used.

.Top-to-bottom writing mode and underline

.Top-to-bottom writing mode, underline and rotate
image::https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg-test-suite/raw/master/doc-images/a-writing-mode-017.png[]

Yes, this is the holy undefined behaviour. Everyone is producing a different result and everyone is incorrect.

PS: At this point I'm not sure if even resvg and Chrome are correct...

=== Filters

At this point, the only problem with filters is their amount. SVG support 15 of them.
It takes a lot of code, but essentially what we do is a basic sanitization.

The main problem with filters is an actual rendering, which will be discussed later.

=== Markers

**TODO**

There are no markers in the render tree. All markers will be resolved and instanced as shapes.

// Orientation algorithm
// Clipping
// mid-marker on ArcTo

=== Paint server attributes inheritance

**TODO**

=== Shapes conversion

There are no shapes in the render tree, only paths. So all shapes are converted into paths.
The conversion process is fairly simple and described in the SVG spec.
Only complex parts are rect's `rx`/`ry` attributes resolving and units conversion.

=== Units conversion

Units conversion is fairly simple, except `em`/`ex` units.
Lets say you have an SVG that looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <g font-size="20">
        <g font-size="200%">
            <g font-size="larger">
                <rect width="0.5em" height="0.5ex"/>
            </g>
        </g>
    </g>
</svg>
----

What's the rect's width and height? The answer is 24 and 12 respectively.

The trick is that font units should be resolved from top to bottom, so:

1. 20
2. 20 * 200% = 40
3. 40 * 1.2^1 = 48 (https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/fonts.html#propdef-font-size[details])
4. width: 48 * 0.5 = 24
5. height: (48 * 0.5) / 2 = 12

== Rendering

**TODO**

// === Filters

// Complex transform
// feDisplacementMap UB
// enable-background
// sRgb - LinearRGB
// FillPaint/StrokePaint UB
// filter on zero sized object/empty group

// === Images

// SVG sanitization
